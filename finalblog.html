								Data Art and Data Visualization both go hand in hand with representation as their different forms and methods both represent their data differently, either it being more personal and subjective or to convey a clear message. But before we are able to understand which form accompanies what and why, it is important to understand how representation signifies these methods. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Representation on its own, “refers to the ways in which meaning is created and conveyed through various forms of media and culture” (Kidd, 2015) it involves the use of different data, images, languages etc. to correlate specific data types towards trying to represent certain ideologies and meanings. “Reality is constructed in media and cultural texts through the use of signs and codes (Kidd, 2015. Pp 19) these signs influence everyone’s perceptions differently, and therefore represent different things. 
							</p>

							<p>
								What we need to understand is that meaning is created through Roland Barthes The denotations and the 
                                connotations in a text (Kidd, 2015) Where Saussure’s theories of denotation and Barthes theories of 
                                connotative functions as a way of representation. 
							</p>

							<p>
                                Within web design, these signs and codes work to indicate different meanings and representations through data visualization and data art. Denotation refers to the literal or surface-level meaning of a sign, while connotation refers to the additional meanings or associations that a sign may carry beyond its literal meaning, a good example to see this is through Kidd’s reading. It is mentioned as an example how the apple logos denotative meaning is a literal apple, a fruit,  while the connotative meanings might include ideas like wealth, freshness, or even “posers, or as unimaginative followers”(Kidd, 2015. Pp 23). Whilst these representations might not be what the company intended, people read different elements according to their various social and cultural experiences. 
							</p>

							<p>
								This is something that is important to understand within web design as when creating a product, we must aim to create one that has both a denotative and connotative meaning, which users will represent at will. You learn to manipulate your structure and layout to appeal to certain people’s ideologies and ways of thinking. Not only in terms of website structure, but more importantly, connotative and denotative representation is seen through our data, especially that of data art and data visualization.  
							</p>

							<p>
								They are both capable of producing informative, creative visuals by using a “combination of info visuals and mathematical deduction to extract patterns in massive, dynamically changing information spaces.” (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007. (1)) To engage in creating visualizations with artistic impact to invoke certain emotions from the “impact of color schemes on perception in geographic mapping to the layout algorithms and data filtering used in network visualizations” (Leetaru, 2019). However, they contain different methods which are used to represent different goals, to different audiences. 

							</p>

							<p>
								Data Visualizations transforms this data into graphical or interactive forms that make it easier to analyze. It is typically a denotative meaning and message is clear as it stays literal with what it is trying to portray. Its representation is to create data for clarity, accuracy and consistency. (LinkedIn, 2023) Their sole purpose is knowledge generation’ (McCosker and Wilken 2014: 155) as well as to bring forms together such as “images, symbols, tabular and graphical content and text in order to tell stories” (Kidd, 2015. Pp 30).  Catering either to those within science fields, or even creative ones as data visualization can cater to both artistic practices by manipulating the graphs elements visually, or using it for scientific purposes as means to better display complex sets of data and gather trends and patterns. 
							</p>

                            <p>
                                Within my website, I have utilized tabular content to generate knowledge to the viewer, as well as images and text to tell a story, being the Nasa APOD in this case. Machin and Mayr discuss on how the purpose of an image and depending on whether it is connotative or denotative depends on how it is used, in my context, it is purely denotative as it is placed within a space themed website, displaying the exact image and text the actual Nasa picture of the day displays. There are no hidden meanings yet it brings meaning by, according to Machin and Mayr, its presentational context, as well as historical context. Where its meaning shifts based off where it is displayed, when and what is seen within the picture. Displayed on my website, its meaning contributed to the overall layout and consistency within, as well as to represent and teach users daily information on astronomy which will obviously change in future, deeming past events historical. My charts, are a direct representation of the Nasa’s NeoW data, portraying data’s information and trends in relation to certain factors such as asteroid size, magnitude, how many were near misses etc.

                        Data art on the other hand, is not as structured and strict as data visualization as it focuses more on aesthetics, emotions and conveying story. It stands as connotative data where the connotations “come from our various social and cultural experiences and knowledges, and are, in part of course, informed by and reflected in the media and advertising” (Kidd, 2015. Pp 24) and so according to different people’s ideologies, the data art can be viewed differently according to each persons understanding of what it represents. The data art is “more than simply visualizing information—that it serves as a metaphor for human experience” (Laurie Frick) an example of this can be seen within Frick’s work, Floating Data where she took “thousands of Italian laminate countertop samples from a recycling center and created a series of canvases and billboard-sized murals based on her temperament” (Urist, 2015)
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Even though Data Art is more personalized and artistic in relation to data visualizations, doesn’t mean it only contains artistic expression. It is a mix of logical data sets, that the artist manipulates in order to evoke a certain message or leave room for interpretation. Looking at Natalie Miebachs work, she translates weather data into “complex structures and musical scores” which can be read artistically as a sculpture, but also read scientifically as the collection of trends of scientific data. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        In the day and age where technology is prevalent, representing and expressing these ideologies, messages as well as social and political views are best designed to cater to the modern population who spend majority of their time indulging in technology. Data art can bring people awareness, such as Roeser discusses in terms of climate change, inciting people to take action by better understanding technological benefits and risks. The artist decides what the art represents, which emotions or messages it evokes, however because it is based off of data, “the piece has a more objective truth behind its construction and does not solely come from the artist's imagination.” (Benzi, 2020)
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Looking within my data art, originally, I misunderstood its purpose and intent, it is supposed to represent artistic expression, emotion, story that others can interpret according to their connotative thoughts. Originally my idea was to make a video game on asteroids, however thanks to research and my peers’ comments, I was able to understand that this form of “data art” was not data driven artwork. This aided me in creating my first static piece, where I’ve created shapes based off of certain days asteroid information such as size, velocity etc. It was deemed a successful and creative data art according to feedback which prompted me to create my second piece, whose shapes are similarly influences by asteroid data, and can be interacted and manipulated by the viewer to create their own piece by moving elements around. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Data art, can evoke a more personal message than can be challenged and viewed differently per person which Is why I felt that it would be cool to let users manipulate its layout and shape by moving it around to create new shapes, still based off of the same data. Similarly, to The Secret Lives of Numbers, by Golan Levin and collaborators, “it is an interactive system that invites the viewer to explore how the usage patterns of numbers reflect culture, history, and biology” (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007. (3.2)) The arbitrary data set is a compilation of data which creates great cultural significance according to how it is displayed, interacted with, brush styles etc. Leaving to be represented according to what the viewer represents the data. I have tried to do the same with my piece.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Data Art and Data Visualizations differ in the sense that Data Visualization aims to make data more accessible and understandable, whilst data art makes it more engaging and interactive. However, they both go hand in hand in creating meaningful, engaging content. Through analyzing them, we “draw meaning, find patterns, make associations, create maps and models which help us get insights, understand trends, and make informed decisions” (Treehouse). They are both a method of compressing vast quantities of data into something representable and readable. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        They are very effective methods as “they shift the balance between perception and cognition to take better advantage of the brain’s abilities”. ( Treehouse) Our brain processes information through its visual perception (seeing) and cognition (thinking), perception as Treehouse quotes, is handled at the visual cortex (rear of the brain) and responsible for quick, efficient actions. Cognition is handled within the cerebral cortex (front of the brain) and responsible for slower responses. Data visualization and art shifts more towards visual perception, as through processing data and information through these methods we are able process information more quickly than if looking at a plain data set consisting of 1000 numbers. People also process information differently, such as creative thinking and logical thinking, which is why there are a variety of different data art and data visualizations designed to cater to different ways of thinking as we discussed above.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Even though they both represent different methods and outlooks, they can also be used as representation. For example, Data Visualization in the form of Infographic is the perfect tool to represent itself as a persuasion method, such as in advertising. Adverts, according to Guy Cook utilize these images, word play, photography, puns, cartoons etc., to compress a story that is often memorable, enjoyable and amusing. (Cook 2001: 3) It is the perfect tool to contain these elements and its methods of persuasion can influence people’s beliefs as well as behaviors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with Data art, it can also be used to represent identity politics. Kidd highlights the importance of understanding representation as a power of shaping out identities and understanding the ways in which we are perceived by others. “Visual representation of data that can help individuals and groups better understand themselves and their identities” (Kidd, 2015) The visualizations are used to represent data such as gender, race that, relate to social issues, income equality etc. They are tools that can help relate people to the data on a personal level through data art, or as Wattenberg discusses, can highlight and help the individuals understand where within that data they fit culturally, socially, sexually etc, through these data collections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through analyses and research, we can see that data art and data visualization both hold different ways through which they represent data, as well as represent ideologies. They both use data as “their source of inspiration, information or innovation” (LinkedIn, 2023) I have learnt through my journey the outcomes these methods are sought to evoke and have manipulated my sets to create such outcomes. Even though my data art and visualizations might not evoke a persuasive, cultural, social impact, they still represent data in such ways that define what the different data sets are sought to represent. Be it direct trends and identifying patterns within Data visualization, or through Data art, having data create an artistic piece, that opens up for personal interpretation.
