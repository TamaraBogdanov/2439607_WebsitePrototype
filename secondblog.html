							<p>
								When creating my website, I was very reliant on a few sources to help me create an effective UI and
								UX system.
							</p>

							<p>
								Data Visualisation, as we know is “interpreting or translating data into a communicative visual”
								(Wits, 2023) and we will be looking through how I used a few pointers from Studio, by UXPIN’s “The
								Basic Principles of User Interface Design” to manipulate data and communicate its visual meaning to
								the viewer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Firstly, we are meant to “Place Users at the Centre”. (UXPIN, 2022) Understanding what modern-day
								users like and which designs best cater to them. Upon research, several people as well as online
								sources such as dribbble’s “Top Web Design Trends of 2023” allude to minimalism and dark mode
								being amongst the most popular. One of UXPIN’s pointers are to “Aim for Simplicity” (UXPIN, 2022)
								and for this reason I have decided to combine both dark mode and minimalistic elements in order to
								create a simple, easy to navigate website featuring. It also perfectly aligned with the contents within
								the website as it is structured around Data Visualisation, more in particularly that of Nasa.
							</p>

							<p>
								Overall, we look to “Strive for Clarity” (UXPIN, 2022) and have an easy-to-understand interface to
								make our users lives easier. This is where my minimalistic design really shines. There aren’t really
								many pages active at the moment, besides the homepage and document page but within them, are
								straight forward elements that describe to the user exactly what the page consists of. The only
								element where there’s some confusion is the moon “logo” on the homepage. Is it part of the
								background? Is it a logo? It can create confusion, especially since now within my prototype website
								it does not yet function.
							</p>

							<p>
								Going back to “Striving for Clarity”, we can further look into this and how it relates to “Minimizing
								Actions and Steps Per Screen” (UXPIN, 2022). For now, my homepage and document page are the
								only active pages within the prototype, both of which I believe have one primary focus. My
								homepage plans to show off the displayed Nasa API on the right as well as a summary of the website
								present on the left. The button underneath the summary would then take you to a page describing
								data visualisation in depth. This primarily focuses on the homepage describing how this website is
								structured around data visualisation, how I will display Nasa’s API to depict this, as well as a future
								link to summarize Data Visuals in more depth.
							</p>

							<p>
								My experiences so far are found within my documents page. There is a blog post as well as design
								doc of my processes constructing the website itself. This is all documented within two small blocks,
								on either side of the screen. I have done this to keep the information short and simple, in order to
								minimize the actions as well as confine all that information in a smaller place instead of scattering it
								all on the actual screen page like I did with my previous websites design doc. It made for a previously
								unorganized mess where it made the actual design docs screen extremely long, which I sought to
								avoid here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Both these two pointers of “Striving for Clarity” and “Minimizing Actions Per Screen” can all also be
								achieved through “Reducing Cognitive Load” (UXPIN, 2022) Here we can also look at Knaflic’s
								Storytelling with Data, Chapter 3. “Clutter is your enemy”, and it “can make something feel more
								complicated than it actually is” (Knaflic 2015, pp 71-73) This can create not only confusion, but
								irritation amongst users, causing them to click off our site. This is why my websites minimalistic
								design yet again works well as it is straightforward, depicts what each page offers and where you
								are. However, being the prototype, my website does feel a bit too empty for now, but those empty
								spaces are merely just placeholders for the visions I have in future.
							</p>

							<p>
								“Visual Structure” (UXPIN, 2022) is one of the most important pointers mentioned here. It is what
								ties in the elements mentioned above into place. Knaflic’s Storytelling with Data, Chapter 5 talks
								about “how to think like a designer” (Knaflic 2015, pp 127) and how certain elements need to be
								grouped, highlighted and structured accordingly in order to display certain feedback. He mentions
								how you should “highlight the important stuff” (Knaflic 2015, pp 129) such as making them bold,
								coloured or bigger in size.

                <div class="scrollObject2">
                    <p>
                        I have done this within my website by sizing up headings to be the biggest
                        size as it is the focal point of my website. Looking at the homepage, besides the heading the next
                        biggest importance is the Navbar, holding a slightly smaller font. Navigation is the key to a website,
                        but it should not be the focal point of each page, and therefore not the largest font.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        The smallest font embodies the summary of the page. This does not make it the least important, but
                        it is bound by the focal point of the heading which draws users automatically to the body of the text.
                        All of my texts embody the colour white to contrast against the dark background and signify
                        importance. The button sitting within the homepage summary is a different colour that of light blue,
                        to also contrast against the dark blue/ black background but also informs people of its presence. A
                        different colour to signify it is not just normal text.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Within my documents page I have done a similar job where my headings for the design doc and
                        blogs sit at the largest, alerting people to what each of the boxes contents are about. Each
                        subheading consists of a lighter blue. To highlight different sections. If everything was white, it
                        would create confusion as people would have difficulty separating sections. This would also make it
                        appear to have way more text than it actually does as it would sit as one large paragraph.
                        Discouraging people to read.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        “Providing Useful Feedback” (UXPIN, 2022) is another very important pointer within web design. My
                        main form of useful feedback sits within the Navbar and upon hovering over a link, displays to the
                        user which link is being hovered over and which page this would take them to. As well as the scroll
                        option located on each box within the documents page. However, upon experimentation I did notice
                        many faults within my feedback. The button located within the homepage is just static. It does not
                        show the user any feedback when hovered over and just appears non interactive, even though it
                        works. Then when users does click on this button, it’s suppose to take them to the Data Visuals Page,
                        however because it’s a placeholder and contains no headings or indications to which page the user is
                        on, it creates confusion. Because this was a prototype website, I didn’t focus much on the
                        placeholders but through navigating through the links and pages and getting confused on where I
                        was, helped me realize the importance of feedback and how to efficiently communicate it in future.
    
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Finally, we can discuss the final two pointers I have used for my website, being the “Flexibility”
                        (UXPIN, 2022) and “Providing a Clear Next Step” (UXPIN, 2022). Flexibility wise, it is important that
                        every website is responsive on multiple platforms as not everybody accessing the site will be on the
                        same device. I have created a semi responsive site for my pages, but it is far from perfect. For now, it
                        is only responsive to an iPhone SE device. It can also function on other smaller devices, but not well.
                        Even through implemented, this is something I need to work to perfect as it is one of the most
                        important.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        “Providing a Clear Next Step” is the pointer that wraps every element thus mentioned together. Its
                        function is to ensure every interaction includes a “clear next step” (UXPIN, 2022). Knaflic’s
                        Storytelling with Data, Chapter 4 speaks about “focusing on the audience’s attention” (Knaflic 2015,
                        pp 99) and how it’s important to create a site featuring around the three types of memory within
                        our brain. Iconic, short term and long term.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        “Iconic information stays in your iconic memory for a fraction of a second before its forwarded to
                        your short-term memory.” (Knaflic 2015, pp 101) This is why it is important to create striking UX/UX
                        that is carefully positioned and styled in order to appeal to the persons iconic memory and be
                        remembered for the long term, allowing them to remember elements within your website instead of
                        spending eternity searching for them.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        If something is oblivious it will fly straight over a user’s head, and they will forget about it. That is
                        why I have simplified and structured my website, or at least plan to, to appeal to this. Everything is
                        structured in a way that is easy for users to navigate and remember what information lies on which
                        page. There is no cluttered information that confuses users. Homepage contains two elements, API
                        and Summary. Document contains two elements, Blog and Design Doc and future pages will
                        probably contain one to two elements. This allows for users to easily remember these key elements
                        per page and allow for easy navigation.
                    </p>
