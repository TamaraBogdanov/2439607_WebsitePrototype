						<h2>Style Guide</h2>
					</header>

					<p>
						With having to implement our api data from Nasa, i immediately
						thought of a space themed website where the Nasa live data would fit
						perfectly into. This website isnt a website about space, but rather
						just contains a dark theme centering around how the Nasa api would
						fit into appropriately. My colour themes revolve around black, white
						and light blue. This makes it easy on the viewers eye as the white
						text works well to contrast against the dark background. In order to
						not strain the viewers eye with multitude of white text i have also
						added light blue colours to contrast well against the dark
						background, but not be too bright like the white and cause eye
						strain.
					</p>

					<p>
						My homepage is simple and doesnt include a lot of information.
						Displayed on the left is a brief overview of the website. Underneath
						is a button which leads into the data visuals page which will
						contain all visual data within the future. On the right side of the
						page, atop the image of the earth the Nasa live api would be
						displayed. My navbar is also kept simple. A few links to all my
						pages with the inclusion of a moon shaped logo on the left.
					</p>
					<p>
						For now all of my pages follow the same background as they are just
						placeholders for the meantime. My documents page is where users can
						find my blog posts as well as design documents displaying my process
						on the website. I have structured it to be two bodies of text with
						scroll bars side by side. This gives the page a neat look especially
						since the blog post and design doc contain so much information.
					</p>
					<p>
						The background to these textboxes are transparent with a slight
						light blue hue in order to match the background. The blue hue once
						again adding to the themes of colours used. I found it also easier
						on the eye as a solid background would stand out too much from the
						image in the back. It would not only look ugly and take away from
						the visuals of the background but it would also be straining as
						there would be way too many colours showcased on the page.
					</p>

					<h3>Revised Style Guide</h3>

					<p>
						I have stuck to the space themed website, only utilizing a few
						colours to make up my site. Such as white, black, dark, purple and light
						blue. (Space Colours)
					</p>

					<p>
						All of my main headings on every page accompany the same light blue
						hue which stands out from the dark background. The art section page
						is the only page where the main text is just white, but this is
						purely because it is not a header yet, just simply placeholder text
						to alert the user content there will be placed in future.
					</p>
					<p>
						My buttons, bar chart as well as text boxes all have that same
						light blue colour, standing out from the predominantly white text.
						My footer and search bar are the same blue, just a bit darker to
						also stand out, but not too much. I also wanted a few different hues
						instead of just light blue and white. Purples and pinks, colours typically associated with a galaxy is 
						what i decided to use on a few elements such as the new interactive scatter plot and some text colours, such as on
						my blog page. 
						I have done this to break away from all of the same coloured themes and give it some more life.
					</p>

					<p>
						Each page but the data visualization and design page, contain the same background
						image which works well with the content and space theme. I have
						decided to change it up for the data visualizations and design page not only to
						create a bit of change, but because these are no static pages that involve scrolling. I thought scrolling down 
						the vast emptiness of space would be cooler than a reocurring image of earth. 
					
					</p>
					<p>
						However, my biggest reason for the background change was
						because i was putting in different images from Nasa's live data
						which would make the page look very busy. If the images would
						display on the left, the earths image would sit on the right and
						create a very busy environment. If my api image would sit on the
						right, there would be too much cluttering of images happening on the
						right side. The page distribution would feel uneven. Not only this,
						but my bar graph was the same blue hue as dispicted in the earths
						background image. I did not want to create a page that had too many
						of the same colours, or too many colours overall especially with the
						images. So due to this, i added in a "space" background which nicely
						displays the busy information below and doesnt make it feel
						cluttered. It also gives the page a cool, vastnest of space effect
						as the same background image is still displayed the further down the
						user scrolls. The black background works well as the many different
						colours of my Image API could make the page feel too busy with the
						wrong background. It also works well with the purplish scatter plot and  blue bar graph, as
						well as consistent white text i have throughout.
					</p>

					<p>
						On my documents page, i have completely redesigned it to give it a more interactive and non cluttered feel. 
						My design doc was already getting super lengthy, it was annoying to have to scroll down a small box for something with
						so much information. The same thing with the blog posts. For this reason i have decided to split the pages 
						and display them seperately. My blog post page, displays a sneak peak of my three blog posts, which one can click 
						to read more. This will then open up a seperate page with the full blog post. 
					</p>
					<p>
						My design document has taken a very similar theme to my very first website, but i have refined it a lot. There is a 
						sticky navigation menu on the left which consist of a few links, which take you to different parts of the page as you scroll further down. 
						I have also decided to display my wireframes differently, i have placed them in an accordion which nicely confines them to a few headings, 
						which expand with the actual wireframe and descriptions upon click. This makes this information nice and confined and not just 
						taking up even more space in my already long document. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I have also decided to add a footer to every page to give my website
						a finished look, as it was mentioned before that without one it made
						my website feel "endless". The footer's colour is a darker blue with
						small white writing, which fits the theme of my website and adds to
						its consistency, but to also make it stand out from the rest, just
						not too much hence the backgrounds darker colour. 
					
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="mainSection" id="UI/UX">
					<header><h2>UI and UX</h2></header>

					<p>
						Simplicity was the main focus of my website. Since it would be
						structured around data visualization, i wanted to create a modern
						simplstic look so that when data api's and arts were added it
						wouldnt feel cluttered. For this reason it would make it very easy
						for the user to navigate around the pages and view the different
						information without it being cluttered and causin eye strain.
					</p>

					<p>
						My home page is simple. As explained within the style guide,
						features a brief summary of the website along with a button that
						will take the user to the visual data page if they wish to learn
						more about what this website is about. The contrasting white text
						leads the viewers eyes to the brief first. My plan would be to also
						add the Nasa api on the right of the homepage as it is equally
						improtant and relevant to what the website is about. The users eyes
						would wander back and forth between the two to give them a better
						understanding.
					</p>
					<p>
						My navbar is displayed at the top right, above the summary and
						background image to stand out from them. Its font not as big as the
						homepage heading as it is not the main focal point of the page.
						However it is a white contrasting colour that still sticks out and
						once users are done exploring the homepage their attention can be
						averted to the navbar. When one hovers their cursor over it, it
						displays a interactive white line transition signaling to users
						which link they are hovering over and where it would take them.
					</p>

					<p>
						My documents page being the only active page besides the homepage
						offers the same consistent background but i have decided to
						implement two text boxes with scroll bars aside as the information
						from my blogs and my design document are large. Displaying them in
						these small boxes gives my page the same consistent simplistic feel
						and doesnt trouble the users with bodies and bodies of information.
						Rather they can choose what they wish to view by scrolling.
					</p>
					<p>
						The website as a whole isnt revolving around space and nasa apis,
						but rather how i use and structure my data. My homepage would cater
						for the display of the nasa api where the rest of my pages will
						feature other data and information added in the future. Ive done
						this to show the user that i can implement data accordingly and not
						have a website with a live Nasa information displayed randomly. It
						all has to fit in place and every bit of information and display has
						to have a consistent meaning behind it.
					</p>
					<h3>Revised UI and UX</h3>

					<p>
						I think i consistently kept up with the simplcity aspect of the
						website. I tried my best to use my ui and ux to minimalize clutter
						and stay neat the best way i could.
					</p>
					<p>
						My homepage was originally going to contain my API but with me
						realizing we will need to display two API visualizations i decided
						to rather group them together in one page to work as a whole. If i
						had not this, there would be one small visualization sitting alone
						on the page and one random visualization sitting on the homepage. It
						would mess with the spacing and layouts so i have decided against
						this.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have also added a search bar to load all the api data. Admittedly,
						whilst this slows down the performance of that page, i really wanted
						to create a cool effect where the user could really engage with the
						data and manipulate its outcome based off of different dates. Like
						this it wasnt just the same information displayed over and over
						again, it is engaging to where you could cycle between multiple
						different dates and recieve different information.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have decided to group both API visualizations in different
						sections within the page, not only because they display different
						data but because the chart would take a while to load from the rest.
						Whilst the chart was loading, the astronomy image and description
						API would at least be present as the main emphasis on the page, the
						chart sitting below that, nicely spaced out.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have also decided to stick with the two text boxes for the
						documents page because it gives my website a neater look. The more
						information i add, the longer the text boxes are which make it for a
						very tedious read where the user just has to scroll down to read
						further. This is something i will look into fixing in the future but
						for now, my two blog posts and design doc fit well within.
					</p>
					<p>
						It was a bit challenging to group some of the UI and display it
						accordingly because i had a lot of divs present which once changed
						to a more semantic text, would shift items around my webpage.
						Fortunately, i was able to remove majority of my divs and fix this,
						but there are still a few divs present that for the time being,
						cannot be changed without shifting information all over the place.
						This is something i will work on in future. For now i was able to
						neaten my code up a bit and create for a more semantic website
						whilst keeping elements in my page intact. Even though my layouts
						fit perfectly on my laptop, majority of them are unfortunately hard
						coded to keep my UI and UX in place. This is something i have been
						struggling with, though my UI UX elements go well, they
						unfortunately tend to shift around pages sometimes due to my
						grouping. This also affects my Responsiveness which i will go into
						further below.
					</p>
					<p>
						The page where my UI and UX were incrediblly important was in my
						Data Visuals page. Because i have implemented a "search bar" that
						only loads content based off of certain dates there were many
						indicatiors that had to be added to let the user know what to do,
						what is happening etc. Examples are, when the user would just click
						to "search" without having put in a date, obviously nothing would
						happen and no content would load. Due to this, i have added a small
						description at the top of the page just notifying users how the page
						works, what content it offers etc. I have also added a simple alert
						function that if users have not selected a date and click to search,
						an alert will pop up and notify them to select one.
					</p>
					<p>
						Future dates, obviously will have no content as we are situated
						within the present. So i have also added an alert function that if,
						users click a date in future will simply just alert them that the
						action cannot proceed, they cannot select a future date.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another issue i had to tackle with was that on search, my API image
						and description (from APOD) would load first, and the d3 chart (from
						Asteroids NeoWs) would only load after. My page was structured to
						hide all of the information, until a date has been selected,
						otherwise random "missing" images and random hovering text would be
						present. Because my chart and its information was only displayed
						further down into the page when the user scrolls, as it is loading
						it only displayed the APOD image and description on the main page,
						and made it seem like there was nothing more as the page didnt
						expand. Naturally, users will eventually click off, not expecting
						anything else to pop up so it was vital for me to add a loader,
						telling users that there is a chart loading below, to please be
						patient. This was users know there is still more information on the
						page below the API image and description.

									My first iteration included a homepage where you could scroll
									down. I thought to display the main idea of the website on the
									left just like in my final iteration however, on the right
									hand side of the page would be a huge button which would take
									users to a design doc.
								</p>

								<p>
									My nasa API would be displayed further down below the page. I
									eventually scrapped this idea and thought it would be useless
									just to put that information down there with no context.
								</p>
								<p>
									My final iteration kept a similar homepage but i decided to
									make the page fixed so that you cannot scroll down. I have also scratched
									the original vision for adding one of the APIs here to be displayed. 
									I decided to keep it short and simple, showing a brief overview of what the website is.
									The button below the description would then take the users to the actual data visuals page where 
									the APIs are nicely displayed.
								</p>

								<p>
									I have also decided to rework my navbars contents. My blogs
									and design doc now sit all within the documents page. My data
									visuals and data artwork have their own links.
								</p>

								<p>
									I have also now included a footer within majority of my pages to give it that finished look. The footer, 
									staying that same consistent blue seen throughout. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Overall, the homepage matches not only colour wise, but font wise and layout wise with majority of my other 
									pages to keep that consistent, simplistic look.

									<p>
										Even though my final is similar to the first. I have decided to
										confine it even further. The page still includes the heading, and the blog
										posts on the left within a scroll text box, however the design
										doc would also be confined into a scroll text box as well. Both of them sitting equally next to each other. 
	
									</p>
	
									<p>
										I have decided to implement this as ive realized it would be
										stupid for the user to endlessly scroll down the whole page
										for a design document that would contain so much information.
										Not only that but on the left would just be boxes and boxes of
										blog posts. For now, i have one blog post and my design doc is
										quite lengthy. If i kept the first iteration when the user
										scrolls down it would just be empty on the left side where
										future blog posts would sit.
									</p>
	
									<p>
										Not only this but there would be an information overload for
										the user with bodies and bodies of text everywhere. In
										confining the two sections within text boxes, the user can
										stay in one place and navigate its contents way more easily.
										It also looks way neater and everything has its place on the
										page.
									</p>
									<p>
										
										Similarily to the other pages, i have also decided to add

					<h3>Static Data Planning</h3>
					<p>
						Originally, the plan was to use a singular API from nasa to display both the chart and api data. 
						I have selected the APOD api, which mainly only gave pictures of the day as well as the descriptions and details 
						about chosen image. There was no actual data that could be relayed within the chart. 
					</p>
					<p>
						By looking further, majority of API's didnt have both data i needed, being an Image and image description, as well as 
						adequate data i could make chart out of. This is why i have decided to add an additional API, being the Asteroids NeoWs, which 
						display the near earth object service. This had the perfect data i could use to make a chart. 
					</p>
					<p>
						This is when i also decided to confine both API's under one page. 
						My original plan was to just have an random image from the APOD api load on my homepage, just to give users 
						a hint of what the website is about. 
						But on the homepage, was already an image of earth nicey structured on the right side. The image would just cover it and 
						randomly hover. Adding a description explaining the api would add long paragraphs of text on my homepage which i did not want. 
						The data visuals page was all about showcasing my data, and the API as well as D3 chart would sit there perfectly. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Fixed image and description of a random APOD image sounded boring to me, as well as a random fixed chart of asteroids near earth for a certain date just seemed weird. 
						I wanted to create an interactable environment that changed the API's based off of the users input. 
						A fixed random image and chart of a random day made no sense and no relevance, but if you could manipulate the API's to display according to 
						certain dates would not only be interactable, but fun and interesting. It would give the page more meaning than displaying random elements there.
						And so, i added a search bar that filters by date. 
					</p>
					<p>
						It wasd extremely difficult to achieve this but thankfully, with a lot of practice, research and assistance it came together nicely. 
						It lowered the performance of that page a lot, as the chart took a while to load due to it having to update and change itself based off 
						of the live data but this was why i have indicated a "chart loading, please wait" element to let users know there is still content beneath.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because Nasa obviously only has past data or present data updating on their live server, if the user clicked a date in the future it wouldnt work. 
						Due to this i have added alerts to alert users future dates cannot be selected.
					</p>

					<h3>Interactive Data Planning</h3>
					<p>
						With one of my two static visuals being about Asteroids, i have decided to make my second graph based off of the same API. 
						Last time, both my data visuals were based off of two different API's as i wanted to make it diverse. However, basing something off three API's might be too much information.
					</p>
					<p>
						The APOD doesnt really have any information that can be relayed into a graph, however the Asteroids NeoWs has a ton of information 
						that i could use, which is why i went with that. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Naturally, my graph will be sitting in the data visuals section. I have manipulated the page to change Nasa's API based off of the date selected. 
						I wanted to do the same for this graph. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Since my graph will be relaying asteroid information, more in particularly Asteroid size and magnitude. I have decided to make a scatterplot, 
						where the dots change based off of the asteroid size. The interactive element i have decided to implement, is whilst hovering over the graph an X and Y crosshair will 
						appear telling you exactly what the values on the graph are based off of where your mouse is. 
					</p>
					<p>
						When coming in contact with a circle, it will lock on, change colour and the crosshair will display its value on the x and y axis.
					</p>

						Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature
						of object oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying
						only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction
						refers to providing only essential information about the data to the
						outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.
						<br />
						Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only
						knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car
						or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how
						on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does
						not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation
						of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.

						<b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can implement Abstraction in
						C++ using classes. Class helps us to group data members and member
						functions using available access specifiers. A Class can decide
						which data member will be visible to outside world and which is not.
						<br />
						<b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One more type of abstraction in
						C++ can be header files. For example, consider the pow() method
						present in math.h header file. Whenever we need to calculate power
						of a number, we simply call the function pow() present in the math.h
						header file and pass the numbers as arguments without knowing the
						underlying algorithm according to which the function is actually
						calculating power of numbers. <br /><br /><b
							>Advantages of Data Abstraction: </b
						><br />
						1. Helps the user to avoid writing the low level code.<br />
						2. Avoids code duplication and increases reusability.<br />
						3. Can change internal implementation of class independently without
						affecting the user.<br />
						4. Helps to increase security of an application or program as only
						important details are provided to the user.
