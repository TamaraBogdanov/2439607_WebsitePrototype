								Data Art was something that was extremely difficult for me to understand initially.
                                 I knew it was art made from data but how exactly? And what can be classified as art?. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Since my website is based on NASAs’ Api, most specifically that of the Asteroids NeoWs
                                 (Near Earth Object Web Service) and the APOD (Astronomy picture of the day). I thought, 
                                 using the asteroids data I could make a space shooter type of game where you protect the earth 
                                 from the rockets. With the Nasa APOD I thought of compiling around 50 or so images into a collage
                                  form and turn it into a certain picture. This is all art no? Whilst it is, it is not necessarily 
                                  data art. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Through properly engaging with the readings and extensively researching, I was not only able to 
                                understand the definition but create a form of data art for the Nasa Asteroid NeoWs that I think 
                                is perfect in conveying the true meaning of data driven art. 
							</p>

							<p>
                                According to Viégas and Wattenberg’s Artistic Data Visualization: Beyond Visual Analytics. 
                                They discuss how “Data visualization is usually viewed as a tool to support analytic reasoning.” (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2017) 
                                By taking scientific data, we are able to display it in such a way that governs not only scientific meaning,
                                 but artistic as well. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Using actual data, in this case from Nasa’s Asteroid NeoWs, I have decided to create a piece that uses this scientific data 
                                to create an artistic piece. For a certain number of days, a line will be drawn to define that day. The lines width, 
                                height etc will all change depending on the different asteroids data within that day. See it as there being multiple lines
                                 going down vertically for many different days, all consisting of different sized bubbles throughout the lines which
                                  represents the data changes within that day. 
							</p>

							<p>
								I thought this was a brilliant idea not only because it allows you to see trends from different asteroids
                                 on different days, but because it also creates for a very artistic piece. Just like seen in Jason Salavon’s 
                                 example piece the “Last Clock”, Viégas and Wattenberg mention how the clock “becomes a unique emblem of its 
                                 surroundings” (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2017). It is not used for surveillance or video watching, but rather 
                                 creates a meaningful piece of recording time and place. This is what my piece does as well, whilst the data 
                                 isn’t necessarily interactable, it creates a piece governing asteroid surroundings by creating a pattern based 
                                 off of their time and space. It is a recording of actual asteroid recordings, for various different days to create a
                                  meaningful pattern.

							</p>

							<p>
								These patterns within my data art, show how “Many data-oriented artworks use sophisticated visualization techniques
                                 that have been developed in academia, but at the same time the techniques are used in a very different style.” (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2017) 
                                 My technique here is to display that information in an artistic fashion, straying away from your academic charts etc,
                                  all through using explanatory and exploratory power described within Riche et all’s, Exploration and Explanation in 
                                  Data Driven Storytelling .

                        Riche mentions how these data driven stories are centred around “combining exploration and explanation in creative new ways”
                         (Riche et all, 2018. pp- 60) Whilst explanation is where the artists intention provides the viewer with a context, 
                         or information relative to the piece beyond just the raw data. It gives them an understanding of what the piece is 
                         about and doesn’t open much room for interpretation. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Whilst my data can be seen as explanatory, as I describe to the readers what the art is about, and what it features.
                         It is also exploratory as I do not show, nor go into depth on how the data is displayed. There are no labels
                          and there are mainly just patterns showing different asteroid data. This opens up for more interpretation 
                          from viewers as well as investigation in potentially seeing patterns of data previously unseen before. 
                          It allows for them to “explore” hence, exploratory data. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Whilst I have done this accordingly, I can see a negative aspect to this as my data art to just the naked eye, 
                        can be confusing. What do all of the lines represent, why are there bubbles? Ultimately, it can just appear as
                         random scribbles that are hard to understand. However, at the end of the day, especially through my research
                          within data art, not all data art is recognisable and straight forward. That is the beauty of what is defined as art. 
                          Riche et all mentions this within explanatory and exploratory power, how some are very indirect and need a 
                          lot of exploring, whilst some are straight forward. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        To me, science is art as “Both science and art are human attempts to understand and describe the world around us” (Forbes, 2016) 
                        This is a perfect representation of what data art can do. Though both subjects have different traditions and audiences, 
                        creating my data art enables both scientific audiences and artistic ones to share that data’s meaning according to what
                         they understand. 
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        As Artist Nathalie Miebach mentions in her talks, by creating her pieces of weather data and turning it into
                        complex structures and musical scores, she “challenges assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs 
                        in world of art, versus science” (Miebach, 2011) Her art is read differently depending on where it is placed
                        or who views it, but it is still the same piece. Scientists can examine it and see patterns of data as it is,
                        whereas artists can visualize it and interpret its meanings through its patterns, which can also potentially
                        bring unseen knowledge right back to the scientific department. It’s a never-ending circle, and this is what 
                        I hope my data art will bring forth.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        It uses actual Asteroid data to draw specific patterns, which can be interpreted to those without knowing the raw data
                         knowledge as something else. It reveals to us that data can be viewed in multiple ways, artistic or scientific,
                         which opens up new ways of using and analysing data, both being beneficial and as the Forbes article of Why Art and Science
                         Are More Closely Related Than You Think, mentions: That the “technology and decoration” of a piece are applications within 
                        science and art, they are tools used to convey meaning. However, “they don't change how we fundamentally perceive what is 
                        around us. Science and Art do”. (Forbes, 2016)
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Even though art cannot be defined, the above-mentioned statements are what data art means to me, and I feel that 
                        with my piece accompanying both scientific data as well as artistic impression, it allows these, “technological 
                        decorations” to be analyses both scientifically, and artistically, therefore classifying it as Data Driven Art.
