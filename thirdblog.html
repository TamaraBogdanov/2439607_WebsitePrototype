								Interaction and data visualisation is known to go hand in hand. Whilst these are difficult terms to
                                properly define, by looking at Dimara and Perin’s, What is Interaction for Data Visualization. I was
                                able to get a better understanding of how the two work together and how I can use this knowledge
                                to improve my future web development.
							</p>

							<p>
								To start with, in order to get some impactful information, Dimara and Perin’s text was
                                predominantly based on the research and feedback of humans and their thoughts and experiences
                                with these terms. It also just showed me that even terms such as “interactivity” and “data
                                visualisation” may seem so simple, it is always good to research and dive deep into the terms to
                                better understand them, this is also a vital trait to have in the development world as research and
                                feedback will be the basis of improving your work.
							</p>

							<p>
								Within the text, using this feedback gathered they began to discuss how interaction and visualization
                                worked together, and how the actions were classified as both internal and external entities and
                                actions. I was a bit confused on what this meant so through researching I found that External entities
                                means “any individual, organization or government body other than the applicant group.” (Law
                                Insider) and internal actions would then be the recipients within the group.
							</p>

							<p>
                                    External actions for “What Interaction for Visualization Must Involve” is about “interaction being a
                                    dialogue between the user and the visualization system” (Dimara and Perin, 2020) which is made up
                                    of actions involving input, where the visualization system then returns an output/reaction. Similarly,
                                    Internal actions suggested similar where “interaction with a visualization system involves a cognitive
                                    act of the user”. (Dimara and Perin, 2020)
							</p>

							<p>
								When we look at Murray’s Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, he speaks about how
                                “visualization is a process of mapping information to visuals” (Murray, 2017. pp. 1) Data visualisation
                                plays a vital role in mapping the information in order to be read and understood by the user, thus
                                creating an interactive output due to the input received. It “Needs to be visualized in a certain way
                                to show interactivity” (Knaflic, 2015. Chapter 5)
							</p>

							<p>
								Murray dives further into how humans are “intensely visual creatures” (Murray, 2017. pp. 1) and we
                                need patterns, charts, text etc to extract powerful meaning from the information. Without data
                                visualisation, the information becomes boring and dull and leaves no room for interactivity as the
                                user will not only be unable to properly understand but will leave them uninterested. The only
                                interaction you will get is them clicking off.

							</p>

							<p>
								Knaflic discusses how accessibility, affordances and aesthetics are the most important tools in
                                creating successful data visuals. “You need to eliminate distractions, highlight the important stud
                                and create a clear hierarchy of information” in order to “indicate to our audience how to use and
                                interact with our visualizations” (Knaflic, 2015. Chapter 5) 
							</p>

							<p>
								Looking into the work we have done this
                                semester, this is why it is vital for us to use CSS correctly and nicely style, colour code and format our
                                text, layouts and visuals in order to have successful affordances and promote interactivity. With the
                                fairly new concept of D3.js we have been learning, this has been a perfect way to relay information
                                in a clear manner through creating our own charts, and in future as we dive further into this it will
                                open us up too many other of its wonders that will allow us to structure and format our data more
                                neatly.

                        All of these elements of raw data need proper data visualizations not only to process them but give
                        them meaning. We need to manipulate our data visualizations in such a way that it creates
                        interactivity. Dimara and Perin’s text mentions the “Seven Concepts that Characterize Interaction in
                        HCI” (Dimara and Perin, 2020) and how they work together to create interactivity. I have gone
                        through a few and decided four out of seven resonate the most with me in defining interactivity, as
                        well as relating to my course.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        The Transmission is the interaction between the computer and human. It is based off of the
                        “amount of error-free information per time unit that is transferred over a communication channel”
                        (Dimara and Perin, 2020) will depend on how the user interacts with information.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        We also need to remember that according to the text, interactivity can be two things, being how the
                        user understanding the information. They interact and engage with content they understand (UX).
                        The second being how they then physically interact with the visuals (UI) based off of the (UX). Knaflic
                        mentions not to overcomplicate. Complexity will lead in poor interaction and therefore there will be
                        no interactivity.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        This is something we need to understand, as understanding how one interacts with information will
                        give us control.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Control shows us how the user operates through goal driven actions” (Dimara and Perin, 2020) will.
                        We need to understand this and understand how to manipulate our data visuals in order to minimize
                        the error and distance between the user reaching this goal. By making our designs simpler and
                        pleasing, our “audience will have more patience with our visuals, increasing our chance of success
                        for getting our message across” (Knaflic, 2015. Chapter 5)
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        However, even though it is vital to understand how one engages with something, it is also important
                        to understand that different people have different ways of engaging with the material.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        By understanding Embodiment, we need to make our users feel as if the technology is a part of
                        them.
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        Dimara and Perin also mention how “How Visualization Conceptualizes Interaction” and how we
                        need to also create flexible interactions that pay respects to the outside world. External entities
                        suggested how “Many modalities (e.g., gaze, head) tend to be overlooked in visualization” which
                        leads to “disjointed picture of human performance” [79] and lost opportunities to capture user
                        intent” (Dimara and Perin, 2020)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is up to us to create flexible interactions in order to accommodate for this and understand
                        embodiment. The text yet again reviewed papers in order to learn and understand how to do this.
                        Which yet again shows how vital research is in this industry, we need to research every little bit of
                        information so we are able to understand the best forms of creating user flexibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through researching human emotions as well as how certain people with disabilities interact and
                        think, it will allow for us to create visuals to accommodate them, allowing for total comfort when
                        using the platform. Yet again, by doing so our visuals will work hand in hand in successfully relaying
                        the information to the users, and in return provide us with interactivity and embodiment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everything mentioned thus far plays a purpose, but at the end of the day it all falls under
                        Experience. “Human experience as a key factor in how interaction unfolds” (Dimara and Perin, 2020)
                        We need to understand “aesthetics, emotion, fulfilment, surprise, stimulation” (Dimara and Perin,
                        2020) to create good interaction. Emotional usability is vital for us to understand. According to
                        Hassenzahl and Tractinsky (2003), they argued on how “humans interacting with technology are
                        depicted as having mostly negative emotions”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dimara and Perin’s text helped me realise that by creating good data visuals, we promote good
                        interactivity with not only the content, but with the way it is engaged with and this in return
                        promoted good user experience. However, all of this would not be possible without proper forms of
                        research. It was evident on how Dimara and Perin’s text has used research in order to base their
                        arguments and create solid foundation. This is what we as web developers need to strive to do as
                        well. By researching we will be able to understand what our users want, what they think, how they
                        interact. This will help us to create good data visualization and because of understanding what our
                        users want, the data will be successfully interacted with by the users promoting not only mental
                        interactivity, but also physical which as we know, deems whether our website is successful or not.
