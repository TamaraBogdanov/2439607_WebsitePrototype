							<h3>Blog 1 : Data Visualization</h3>

							<p>
								This week we learnt about data visualazation and how “Data
								visualization often results in graphical images of data or
								concepts, which assists making decisions” (Ware 2012). In this
								day and age, it is best paired up with computer software where
								it can be best displayed across all media forms too allow for
								quicker and more efficient data analysing. In order to better
								understand Data visualisation, we need to separate it into two
								categories. Data and visualisation.
							</p>

							<p>
								Data can be many things, but it is usually referred to
								unprocessed information that stands alone and has no meaning. An
								example of this is the number 3. This is the primary data. The
								secondary data “can be considered as information.” (Li 2020, p.g
								21) Where a collection of the primary data is bunched together
								to create meaning. This does not just have to be something
								physical, but something technological as well such as how within
								computers, data is a collection of 1s and 0s which transmit
								electrical signals. We are exposed to data everyday like the
								“World Wide Web, cellular calls, networks of smart home
								applications” (Li 2020, p.g 20). Within the online world, these
								collections of data are then manipulated in countless ways to
								create what is known as the world wide web today.
							</p>

							<p>
								In terms of web design and how we influence the data within the
								World Wide Web (WWW), I relate it to us coding and creating
								semantic markup. We use a series of data to create semantic
								markup, which in return encapsulates our websites information
								and give it meaning within the WWW. When a user searches for
								certain information, the data will help push though the
								information required to the user searching for it. There are
								endless ways we can manipulate and use data, which is very
								important within this course. The data we put in, will help
								shape our websites into a useful tool with useful information
								for the public. However, meaningless data won’t do us any
								justice, which is why it must be paired with visualisation.
								“Information is considered as useful data, which people can
								recognize and understand it.” (Chen 2005) It is important for us
								as web designers to understand how visualisation and
								representation function in order to give our data meaning.
							</p>

							<p>
								Scientific visualisation suggests that “the forms of data
								visualization often refers to simulations, waveforms or volume,
								in which data is explored, transformed and represented as an
								image or simulation in order to obtain insight into the
								phenomena.” (Li 2020, p.g 23) This is how we display our
								information. By means of images, sounds etc. However, it is
								important to understand the representation of this information.
								A standalone image will not provide one much context.
							</p>
							<p>
								We as web developers “need to make conscious decisions as to
								what you foreground, how you construct the signs, how you
								contextualize for interpretation. “(Wits 2023, p.g 21) and by
								doing that we need to first understand signs. Signs are what
								give our information meaning, as when a person looks at the
								information, we need to make sure that that person knows exactly
								what we are referring to within that information. These signs
								are “constructed out of a signifier and a signified” (Wits 2023,
								p.g 8) which are “given meaning through context and
								socio-cultural cues.” (Wits 2023, p.g 8) Without understanding
								these, interpretation is impossible and we as web designers will
								not be able to relay our information out efficiently. When we
								present our data, we need to be aware of how we represent that
								data.
							</p>

							<p>
								“Human perception plays an important role in data
								visualization.” (Ware 2012) We need to understand how we as
								humans perceive information and visual elements. “Human visual
								perception is a very complicated and subjective process, and
								that the effectiveness of the visualization for conveying
								objective understanding based on a wide range of subtle factors.
								“(Reuter, Tukey, Maloney, Pani, & Smith, 1990). It is
								complicated to assume how every person will perceive something,
								The “sign” being our singular piece of data will be influenced
								by the signifier and signified, which will be interpreted
								depending on what context surrounds and forms that data. “The
								construction of the sign matters. The choice of signifier to
								signified matters. (Wits 2023, p.g 9) and we need to manipulate
								this so that our data can be visualized correctly.
							</p>

							<p>
								As mentioned, not everyone will perceive your information the
								same as others which is where we can look at “four theories of
								preattentive processing, which are feature integration theory,
								texton theory, similarity theory, and guided search theory.”
								(Healey 2007) in order to get a ground of how the human body
								reacts and reads visual information. Within a website, the main
								theory I will discuss here is The Texton theory. This relies on
								properties such as width, heights, hues and how “easily an
								object can be distinguished from its distractors.” (Li 2020, p.g
								43) If we want certain data to stick out within our website, we
								need to understand this and make it stick out from the rest in
								order to stand out. By manipulating the data’s hue, patterns,
								width etc it should automatically receive special attention from
								the viewer.
							</p>

							<p>
								In a website point of view, this means we need to manipulate the
								colour or placement of data accordingly in order to attract
								certain people or give people certain cues of where to go and
								what to do. Our manipulation of data within our website will
								allow for people to visualize and interpret that data’s means
								and therefore act upon it. If we can understand the context and
								socio-cultural cues, we can correctly guide users throughout our
								website.
							</p>

							<p>
								Example is” Broadly, red is associated with danger, warning,
								attention, and stopping” (Golutvina, May 28) If a user
								incorrectly enters information within your website,
								understanding how to represent information we should use the
								colour red to alert them that they have entered something
								incorrectly. “If the error is not caused by the user, there is
								no need to bother people with the intensive, annoying red.”
								(Golutvina, May 28) we do not want to bombard the viewer with an
								intense annoying colour, unless something is wrong. It is vital
								to understand what our data represents and how the viewers will
								interpret it. This is the key to creating a successful and
								efficient website.

							<h3>Blog 2 : UX/UX Critical Reflection</h3>

							<p>
								When creating my website, I was very reliant on a few sources to help me create an effective UI and
								UX system.
							</p>

							<p>
								Data Visualisation, as we know is “interpreting or translating data into a communicative visual”
								(Wits, 2023) and we will be looking through how I used a few pointers from Studio, by UXPIN’s “The
								Basic Principles of User Interface Design” to manipulate data and communicate its visual meaning to
								the viewer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Firstly, we are meant to “Place Users at the Centre”. (UXPIN, 2022) Understanding what modern-day
								users like and which designs best cater to them. Upon research, several people as well as online
								sources such as dribbble’s “Top Web Design Trends of 2023” allude to minimalism and dark mode
								being amongst the most popular. One of UXPIN’s pointers are to “Aim for Simplicity” (UXPIN, 2022)
								and for this reason I have decided to combine both dark mode and minimalistic elements in order to
								create a simple, easy to navigate website featuring. It also perfectly aligned with the contents within
								the website as it is structured around Data Visualisation, more in particularly that of Nasa.
							</p>

							<p>
								Overall, we look to “Strive for Clarity” (UXPIN, 2022) and have an easy-to-understand interface to
								make our users lives easier. This is where my minimalistic design really shines. There aren’t really
								many pages active at the moment, besides the homepage and document page but within them, are
								straight forward elements that describe to the user exactly what the page consists of. The only
								element where there’s some confusion is the moon “logo” on the homepage. Is it part of the
								background? Is it a logo? It can create confusion, especially since now within my prototype website
								it does not yet function.
							</p>

							<p>
								Going back to “Striving for Clarity”, we can further look into this and how it relates to “Minimizing
								Actions and Steps Per Screen” (UXPIN, 2022). For now, my homepage and document page are the
								only active pages within the prototype, both of which I believe have one primary focus. My
								homepage plans to show off the displayed Nasa API on the right as well as a summary of the website
								present on the left. The button underneath the summary would then take you to a page describing
								data visualisation in depth. This primarily focuses on the homepage describing how this website is
								structured around data visualisation, how I will display Nasa’s API to depict this, as well as a future
								link to summarize Data Visuals in more depth.
							</p>

							<p>
								My experiences so far are found within my documents page. There is a blog post as well as design
								doc of my processes constructing the website itself. This is all documented within two small blocks,
								on either side of the screen. I have done this to keep the information short and simple, in order to
								minimize the actions as well as confine all that information in a smaller place instead of scattering it
								all on the actual screen page like I did with my previous websites design doc. It made for a previously
								unorganized mess where it made the actual design docs screen extremely long, which I sought to
								avoid here.
							</p>

							<p>
								Both these two pointers of “Striving for Clarity” and “Minimizing Actions Per Screen” can all also be
								achieved through “Reducing Cognitive Load” (UXPIN, 2022) Here we can also look at Knaflic’s
								Storytelling with Data, Chapter 3. “Clutter is your enemy”, and it “can make something feel more
								complicated than it actually is” (Knaflic 2015, pp 71-73) This can create not only confusion, but
								irritation amongst users, causing them to click off our site. This is why my websites minimalistic
								design yet again works well as it is straightforward, depicts what each page offers and where you
								are. However, being the prototype, my website does feel a bit too empty for now, but those empty
								spaces are merely just placeholders for the visions I have in future.
							</p>

							<p>
								“Visual Structure” (UXPIN, 2022) is one of the most important pointers mentioned here. It is what
								ties in the elements mentioned above into place. Knaflic’s Storytelling with Data, Chapter 5 talks
								about “how to think like a designer” (Knaflic 2015, pp 127) and how certain elements need to be
								grouped, highlighted and structured accordingly in order to display certain feedback. He mentions
								how you should “highlight the important stuff” (Knaflic 2015, pp 129) such as making them bold,
								coloured or bigger in size.
							</p>

							<p>
								I have done this within my website by sizing up headings to be the biggest
								size as it is the focal point of my website. Looking at the homepage, besides the heading the next
								biggest importance is the Navbar, holding a slightly smaller font. Navigation is the key to a website,
								but it should not be the focal point of each page, and therefore not the largest font.
							</p>

							<p>
								The smallest font embodies the summary of the page. This does not make it the least important, but
								it is bound by the focal point of the heading which draws users automatically to the body of the text.
								All of my texts embody the colour white to contrast against the dark background and signify
								importance. The button sitting within the homepage summary is a different colour that of light blue,
								to also contrast against the dark blue/ black background but also informs people of its presence. A
								different colour to signify it is not just normal text.
							</p>

							<p>
								Within my documents page I have done a similar job where my headings for the design doc and
								blogs sit at the largest, alerting people to what each of the boxes contents are about. Each
								subheading consists of a lighter blue. To highlight different sections. If everything was white, it
								would create confusion as people would have difficulty separating sections. This would also make it
								appear to have way more text than it actually does as it would sit as one large paragraph.
								Discouraging people to read.
							</p>

							<p>
								“Providing Useful Feedback” (UXPIN, 2022) is another very important pointer within web design. My
								main form of useful feedback sits within the Navbar and upon hovering over a link, displays to the
								user which link is being hovered over and which page this would take them to. As well as the scroll
								option located on each box within the documents page. However, upon experimentation I did notice
								many faults within my feedback. The button located within the homepage is just static. It does not
								show the user any feedback when hovered over and just appears non interactive, even though it
								works. Then when users does click on this button, it’s suppose to take them to the Data Visuals Page,
								however because it’s a placeholder and contains no headings or indications to which page the user is
								on, it creates confusion. Because this was a prototype website, I didn’t focus much on the
								placeholders but through navigating through the links and pages and getting confused on where I
								was, helped me realize the importance of feedback and how to efficiently communicate it in future.

							</p>

							<p>
								Finally, we can discuss the final two pointers I have used for my website, being the “Flexibility”
								(UXPIN, 2022) and “Providing a Clear Next Step” (UXPIN, 2022). Flexibility wise, it is important that
								every website is responsive on multiple platforms as not everybody accessing the site will be on the
								same device. I have created a semi responsive site for my pages, but it is far from perfect. For now, it
								is only responsive to an iPhone SE device. It can also function on other smaller devices, but not well.
								Even through implemented, this is something I need to work to perfect as it is one of the most
								important.
							</p>

							<p>
								“Providing a Clear Next Step” is the pointer that wraps every element thus mentioned together. Its
								function is to ensure every interaction includes a “clear next step” (UXPIN, 2022). Knaflic’s
								Storytelling with Data, Chapter 4 speaks about “focusing on the audience’s attention” (Knaflic 2015,
								pp 99) and how it’s important to create a site featuring around the three types of memory within
								our brain. Iconic, short term and long term.
							</p>

							<p>
								“Iconic information stays in your iconic memory for a fraction of a second before its forwarded to
								your short-term memory.” (Knaflic 2015, pp 101) This is why it is important to create striking UX/UX
								that is carefully positioned and styled in order to appeal to the persons iconic memory and be
								remembered for the long term, allowing them to remember elements within your website instead of
								spending eternity searching for them.
							</p>

							<p>
								If something is oblivious it will fly straight over a user’s head, and they will forget about it. That is
								why I have simplified and structured my website, or at least plan to, to appeal to this. Everything is
								structured in a way that is easy for users to navigate and remember what information lies on which
								page. There is no cluttered information that confuses users. Homepage contains two elements, API
								and Summary. Document contains two elements, Blog and Design Doc and future pages will
								probably contain one to two elements. This allows for users to easily remember these key elements
								per page and allow for easy navigation.

							<h3>Style Guide</h3>
							<p>
								With having to implement our api data from Nasa, i immediately
								thought of a space themed website where the Nasa live data would
								fit perfectly into. This website isnt a website about space, but
								rather just contains a dark theme centering around how the Nasa
								api would fit into appropriately. My colour themes revolve
								around black, white and light blue. This makes it easy on the
								viewers eye as the white text works well to contrast against the
								dark background. In order to not strain the viewers eye with
								multitude of white text i have also added light blue colours to
								contrast well against the dark background, but not be too bright
								like the white and cause eye strain.
							</p>

							<p>
								My homepage is simple and doesnt include a lot of information.
								Displayed on the left is a brief overview of the website.
								Underneath is a button which leads into the data visuals page
								which will contain all visual data within the future. On the
								right side of the page, atop the image of the earth the Nasa
								live api would be displayed. My navbar is also kept simple. A
								few links to all my pages with the inclusion of a moon shaped
								logo on the left.
							</p>
							<p>
								For now all of my pages follow the same background as they are
								just placeholders for the meantime. My documents page is where
								users can find my blog posts as well as design documents
								displaying my process on the website. I have structured it to be
								two bodies of text with scroll bars side by side. This gives the
								page a neat look especially since the blog post and design doc
								contain so much information.
							</p>
							<p>
								The background to these textboxes are transparent with a slight
								light blue hue in order to match the background. The blue hue
								once again adding to the themes of colours used. I found it also
								easier on the eye as a solid background would stand out too much
								from the image in the back. It would not only look ugly and take
								away from the visuals of the background but it would also be
								straining as there would be way too many colours showcased on
								the page.
							</p>

							<h3>Revised Style Guide</h3>

							<p>
								I have stuck to the space themed website, only utilizing a few colours to
								make up my site. Such as white, black, dark and light blue. 
							</p>

							<p>
								All of my main headings on every page accompany the same light blue hue which stands out from the dark background.
								The art section page is the only page where the main text is just white, but this is purely because it is not a header yet,
								just simply placeholder text to alert the user content there will be placed in future.
							</p>
							<p>
								My buttons, chart bars as well as text boxes all have that same light blue colour, standing out from the predominantly white text. 
								My footer and search bar are the same blue, just a bit darker to also stand out, but not too much. I also wanted a few different hues
								but just light blue and white. A mix of lighter blues and white with darker blues and black make for a very colour balanced website that doesnt 
								strain the eye. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Each page but the data visualization, contain the same background image which works well with the content and space theme. I have decided 
								to change it up for the data visualizations page not only to create a bit of change, but because it also fitted the themes of the page better. 
								My API's were displaying galaxies, which wouldnt sit right displayed on top of a page with the earth as a background.
							</p>
							<p>
								Even though the 
								asteroid chart is related to asteroids cycling around earth, my biggest reason for the background change was because i was putting in 
								different images from Nasa's live data which would make the page look very busy. If the images would display on the left, the earths image would sit on the right 
								and create a very busy environment. If my api image would sit on the right, there would be too much cluttering of images happening on the right side. 
								The page distribution would feel uneven. Not only this, but my bar graph was the same blue hue as dispicted in the earths background image. 
								I did not want to create a page that had too many of the same colours, or too many colours overall especially with the images. So due to this, i added in 
								a "space" background which nicely displays the busy information below and doesnt make it feel cluttered. It also gives the page a cool, vastnest of space effect 
								as the same background image is still displayed the further down the user scrolls. The black background works well as the many different colours of my Image API could make the page feel too busy with the wrong background. 
								It also works well with the blue bar graph, as well as consistent white text i have throughout.

							

					
							</p>

							<p>
								On my documents page, i have also slightly adjusted the design doc text box to match with the blog post. I thought before it gave a cool effect 
								having a smaller textbox for smaller information, and a larger textbox for the large document but it just made the page look uneven. 
								Now with it being the same size, it looks much neater and even. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I have also decided to add a footer to every page to give my website a finished look, as it was mentioned before that without one it made my website feel "endless". The footer's colour is a darker blue with small white writing,  which fits the 
								theme of my website and adds to its consistency, but to also make it stand out from the rest, just not too much hence the backgrounds darker colour. 
								The only page i wasnt able to add it to was the data visualizations page, purely because it didnt work well with a fixed page, loading into 
								a scrollable one once my bar graph finished loading. It was difficult to manage so i could not add it there, but we will pretend i purposly did this 
								to add to the "vast, never ending" space look of the page.
							</p>

							<h3>UI and UX</h3>
							<p>
								Simplicity was the main focus of my website. Since it would be
								structured around data visualization, i wanted to create a
								modern simplstic look so that when data api's and arts were
								added it wouldnt feel cluttered. For this reason it would make
								it very easy for the user to navigate around the pages and view
								the different information without it being cluttered and causin
								eye strain.
							</p>

							<p>
								My home page is simple. As explained within the style guide,
								features a brief summary of the website along with a button that
								will take the user to the visual data page if they wish to learn
								more about what this website is about. The contrasting white
								text leads the viewers eyes to the brief first. My plan would be
								to also add the Nasa api on the right of the homepage as it is
								equally improtant and relevant to what the website is about. The
								users eyes would wander back and forth between the two to give
								them a better understanding.
							</p>
							<p>
								My navbar is displayed at the top right, above the summary and
								background image to stand out from them. Its font not as big as
								the homepage heading as it is not the main focal point of the
								page. However it is a white contrasting colour that still sticks
								out and once users are done exploring the homepage their
								attention can be averted to the navbar. When one hovers their
								cursor over it, it displays a interactive white line transition
								signaling to users which link they are hovering over and where
								it would take them.
							</p>

							<p>
								My documents page being the only active page besides the
								homepage offers the same consistent background but i have
								decided to implement two text boxes with scroll bars aside as
								the information from my blogs and my design document are large.
								Displaying them in these small boxes gives my page the same
								consistent simplistic feel and doesnt trouble the users with
								bodies and bodies of information. Rather they can choose what
								they wish to view by scrolling.
							</p>
							<p>
								The website as a whole isnt revolving around space and nasa
								apis, but rather how i use and structure my data. My homepage
								would cater for the display of the nasa api where the rest of my
								pages will feature other data and information added in the
								future. Ive done this to show the user that i can implement data
								accordingly and not have a website with a live Nasa information
								displayed randomly. It all has to fit in place and every bit of
								information and display has to have a consistent meaning behind
								it.
							</p>

							<h3>Revised UI and UX</h3>

							<p>
								I think i consistently kept up with the simplcity aspect of the website. I tried my best to use my ui and ux 
								to minimalize clutter and stay neat the best way i could.
							</p>
							<p>
								My homepage was originally going to contain my API but with me realizing we will need to display two API visualizations 
								i decided to rather group them together in one page to work as a whole. If i had not this, there would be one small visualization 
								sitting alone on the page and one random visualization sitting on the homepage. It would mess with the spacing and layouts so i have decided against this.

							</p>
							<p>
								I have also added a search bar to load all the api data. Admittedly, whilst this slows down the performance of that page, i really wanted to create a cool effect 
								where the user could really engage with the data and manipulate its outcome based off of different dates. Like this it wasnt just the same information displayed over and over again, it 
								is engaging to where you could cycle between multiple different dates and recieve different information. 

							</p>
							<p>
								I have decided to group both API visualizations in different sections within the page, not only because they display different data 
								but because the chart would take a while to load from the rest. Whilst the chart was loading, the astronomy image and description API would 
								at least be present as the main emphasis on the page, the chart sitting below that, nicely spaced out.
							</p>
							<p>
								I have also decided to stick with the two text boxes for the documents page because it gives my website a neater look. The more information 
								i add, the longer the text boxes are which make it for a very tedious read where the user just has to scroll down to read further. This 
								is something i will look into fixing in the future but for now, my two blog posts and design doc fit well within. 
							</p>
							<p>
								It was a bit challenging to group some of the UI and display it accordingly because i had a lot of divs present which once changed to 
								a more semantic text, would shift items around my webpage. Fortunately, i was able to remove majority of my divs and fix this, 
								but there are still a few divs present that for the time being, cannot be changed without shifting information all over the place. 
								This is something i will work on in future. 
								For now i was able to neaten my code up a bit and create for a more semantic website whilst keeping elements in my page intact.
								Even though my layouts fit perfectly on my laptop, majority of them are unfortunately hard coded to keep my UI and UX in place. This is 
								something i have been struggling with, though my UI UX elements go well, they unfortunately tend to shift around pages sometimes 
								due to my grouping. This also affects my Responsiveness which i will go into further below.
							</p>
							<p>
								The page where my UI and UX were incrediblly important was in my Data Visuals page. Because i have implemented a "search bar" that only 
								loads content based off of certain dates there were many indicatiors that had to be added to let the user know what to do, what is happening etc. 
								Examples are, when the user would just click to "search" without having put in a date, obviously nothing would happen and no content would load. 
								Due to this, i have added a small description at the top of the page just notifying users how the page works, what content it offers etc. 
								I have also added a simple alert function that if users have not selected a date and click to search, an alert will pop up and notify them to select one. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Future dates, obviously will have no content as we are situated within the present. So i have also added an alert function
								that if, users click a date in future will simply just alert them that the action cannot proceed, they cannot select a future date.

							</p>
							<p>
								Another issue i had to tackle with was that on search, my API image and description (from APOD) would load first, and the d3 chart (from Asteroids NeoWs) would only load after. 
								My page was structured to hide all of the information, until a date has been selected, otherwise random "missing" images and random hovering text would be present. 
								Because my chart and its information was only displayed further down into the page when the user scrolls, as it is loading it only displayed 
								the APOD image and description on the main page, and made it seem like there was nothing more as the page didnt expand. 

								Naturally, users will eventually click off, not expecting anything else to pop up so it  was vital for me to add a loader, telling users that 
								there is a chart loading below, to please be patient. This was users know there is still more information on the page below the API image and description.
							</p>

							<h3>Responsiveness</h3>
							<p>
								Even though i have made majoirty of my website responsive to one iphone device, i still struggle 
								to make flexible elements especially within my new API page which was very difficult to manage. 
								In the time being, my website functions barely on an Iphone SE device, however due to my hardcoding of values 
								many elements shift all around the place.

								<h2>Wireframes</h2>

								<h3>Homepage</h3>

								<p class="iterations">First Iteration</p>
								<figure class="image1">
									<img
										src="Images/homepageFirst.png"
										alt="Homepage First Iteration"
										width="100%"
										height="100%"
									/>
                					</figure>
								<p>
									My first iteration included a homepage where you could scroll
									down. I thought to display the main idea of the website on the
									left just like in my final iteration however, on the right
									hand side of the page would be a huge button which would take
									users to a design doc.
								</p>

								<p>
									My nasa API would be displayed further down below the page. I
									eventually scrapped this idea and thought it would be useless
									just to put that information down there with no context.
								</p>

								<p class="iterations">Final Iteration</p>
								<figure class="image2">
									<img
										src="Images/homepageFinalIT.png"
										alt="Homepage Final Iteration"
										width="100%"
										height="100%"
									/>
                				</figure>

								<p>
									My final iteration kept a similar homepage but i decided to
									make the page fixed so that you cannot scroll down. I have also scratched
									the original vision for adding one of the APIs here to be displayed. 
									I decided to keep it short and simple, showing a brief overview of what the website is.
									The button below the description would then take the users to the actual data visuals page where 
									the APIs are nicely displayed.
								</p>

								<p>
									I have also decided to rework my navbars contents. My blogs
									and design doc now sit all within the documents page. My data
									visuals and data artwork have their own links.
								</p>

								<p>
									I have also now included a footer within majority of my pages to give it that finished look. The footer, 
									staying that same consistent blue seen throughout. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Overall, the homepage matches not only colour wise, but font wise and layout wise with majority of my other 
									pages to keep that consistent, simplistic look. 
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Documents Page</h3>

								<p class="iterations">First Iteration</p>
								<figure class="image1">
									<img
										src="Images/documentsFirst.png"
										alt="Documents Page First Iteration"
										width="100%"
										height="100%"
									/>
                				</figure>
								<p>
									My first iteration included a blogpost section on the left of
									the page. Each blog post would have their own text boxes. As
									the user would scroll further down the actual page it would
									reveal more blogs.
								</p>

								<p>
									On the right hand side would be the design document, however
									the information would just sit neatly atop the page and as you
									scroll down the page, more document information would be
									revealed. My page also included a main title, describing what
									the page is about.
								</p>

								<p class="iterations">Final Iteration</p>
								<figure class="image2">
									<img
										src="Images/documentspageFinal.png"
										alt="Documents Page Final Iteration"
										width="100%"
										height="100%"
									/>
                				</figure>

								<p>
									Even though my final is similar to the first. I have decided to
									confine it even further. The page still includes the heading, and the blog
									posts on the left within a scroll text box, however the design
									doc would also be confined into a scroll text box as well. Both of them sitting equally next to each other. 

								</p>

								<p>
									I have decided to implement this as ive realized it would be
									stupid for the user to endlessly scroll down the whole page
									for a design document that would contain so much information.
									Not only that but on the left would just be boxes and boxes of
									blog posts. For now, i have one blog post and my design doc is
									quite lengthy. If i kept the first iteration when the user
									scrolls down it would just be empty on the left side where
									future blog posts would sit.
								</p>

								<p>
									Not only this but there would be an information overload for
									the user with bodies and bodies of text everywhere. In
									confining the two sections within text boxes, the user can
									stay in one place and navigate its contents way more easily.
									It also looks way neater and everything has its place on the
									page.
								</p>
								<p>
									
									Similarily to the other pages, i have also decided to add 
									a footer with similar colours, to give it a neat finished look.
								</p>
							</section>


							<section>
								<h3>Data Visuals Page</h3>

								<p class="iterations">First Iteration</p>
								<figure class="image1">
									<img
										src="Images/dataFirst.png"
										alt="Data Visuals Page First Iteration"
										width="100%"
										height="100%"
									/>
                				</figure>
								<p>
									Originally, with the main API to be displayed on the homepage, i was going to add 
									the second Data Visual alone within this page. 
									It would inlude a simple heading, image of the api displayed and description. 
								</p>

								<p>
									The background, just like the others would be the same image used on every page.
								</p>

								<p class="iterations">Final Iteration</p>
								<figure class="image2">
									<img
										src="Images/dataFinal.png"
										alt="Data Visuals Page Final Iteration"
										width="100%"
										height="100%"
									/>
                				</figure>

								<p>
									Now both APIs are to be displayed here, but not as static objects pasted on the page 
									like previously envisioned. 
									I would now add a search bar that filters by date, and only once a date has been selected it would load 
									the API and API chart based on the date selected. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Without input, the page stands empty. Merely displaying the page heading, search bar and  text explaining what
									the page offers and displays on input. The background has been changed to a space background, so that when content 
									appears it doesnt conflict. The black black background, working well with all images coming from the API, as well as the 
									chart and consistent white text i have throughout. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Due to the page first being fixed, then scrollable upon search i have not been able to successfully add a footer like present within 
									every other page.
								</p>
								
							</section>

							<h3>Static Data Visualizations Planning</h3>
							<p>
								Originally, the plan was to use a singular API from nasa to display both the chart and api data. 
								I have selected the APOD api, which mainly only gave pictures of the day as well as the descriptions and details 
								about chosen image. There was no actual data that could be relayed within the chart. 
							</p>
							<p>
								By looking further, majority of API's didnt have both data i needed, being an Image and image description, as well as 
								adequate data i could make chart out of. This is why i have decided to add an additional API, being the Asteroids NeoWs, which 
								display the near earth object service. This had the perfect data i could use to make a chart. 
							</p>
							<p>
								This is when i also decided to confine both API's under one page. 
								My original plan was to just have an random image from the APOD api load on my homepage, just to give users 
								a hint of what the website is about. 
								But on the homepage, was already an image of earth nicey structured on the right side. The image would just cover it and 
								randomly hover. Adding a description explaining the api would add long paragraphs of text on my homepage which i did not want. 
								The data visuals page was all about showcasing my data, and the API as well as D3 chart would sit there perfectly. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Fixed image and description of a random APOD image sounded boring to me, as well as a random fixed chart of asteroids near earth for a certain date just seemed weird. 
								I wanted to create an interactable environment that changed the API's based off of the users input. 
								A fixed random image and chart of a random day made no sense and no relevance, but if you could manipulate the API's to display according to 
								certain dates would not only be interactable, but fun and interesting. It would give the page more meaning than displaying random elements there.
								And so, i added a search bar that filters by date. 
							</p>
							<p>
								It wasd extremely difficult to achieve this but thankfully, with a lot of practice, research and assistance it came together nicely. 
								It lowered the performance of that page a lot, as the chart took a while to load due to it having to update and change itself based off 
								of the live data but this was why i have indicated a "chart loading, please wait" element to let users know there is still content beneath.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because Nasa obviously only has past data or present data updating on their live server, if the user clicked a date in the future it wouldnt work. 
								Due to this i have added alerts to alert users future dates cannot be selected.
							</p>

							<h3>Reflection</h3>
							<p>
								Overall, i have improved my website a lot. Before, i misunderstood and believed this website was just a "prototype" site that formed the 
								shell of future content i would add. It left my website feeling very empty. 
							</p>
							<p>
								I have now, structured my website based off of the feedback to give it a more interactive feel. I have stuck with my design decisions of maintaining
								the same by layout, colour and formatting to give the website as a whole a consistent neat feel. All my pages have only one to two contents accrodingly,  as mentioned i would stick by to avoid clutter 
								and emptiness. Each page is balanced accordingly and allows for easy user navigation. 
							
							
								Even through my websites performance has been lowered due to my data visuals page, i feel like it was worth it in order for my site to have the interactive API element 
								included. I 
							</p>
							<p>
								I have also neatened up my code a bit and fixed the layouts of my pages are there were many random sections and tags that added no value or had no start and end. 
								My code was originally full of divs, but i was able to make it more semantic and remove them. The divs still present, are the ones i could not change due to it disrupting 
								my layout which is something i do not understand, but will look to fix in future. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Even though my code is still wonky, especially the html and CSS i do feel that my javaScript has been put well together in order to perfectly display my interactive API element as that was what the JS code was for. 
								I still have a lot to work on, but i definetly have improved and implemented many features that now make my website feel more complete and interactive. 
								The biggest thing i struggled with was the responsivness and even though it is responsive to some degree.... it basically does not function well on other devices without cluttering up.
								This is due to my hardcoding habits which is something i will work and improve on in future.
