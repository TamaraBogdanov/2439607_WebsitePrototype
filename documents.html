              <h2>Data Visualization</h2>

              <p>
                This week we learnt about data visualazation and how “Data
                visualization often results in graphical images of data or
                concepts, which assists making decisions” (Ware 2012). In this
                day and age, it is best paired up with computer software where
                it can be best displayed across all media forms too allow for
                quicker and more efficient data analysing. In order to better
                understand Data visualisation, we need to separate it into two
                categories. Data and visualisation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Data can be many things, but it is usually referred to
                unprocessed information that stands alone and has no meaning. An
                example of this is the number 3. This is the primary data. The
                secondary data “can be considered as information.” (Li 2020, p.g
                21) Where a collection of the primary data is bunched together
                to create meaning. This does not just have to be something
                physical, but something technological as well such as how within
                computers, data is a collection of 1s and 0s which transmit
                electrical signals. We are exposed to data everyday like the
                “World Wide Web, cellular calls, networks of smart home
                applications” (Li 2020, p.g 20). Within the online world, these
                collections of data are then manipulated in countless ways to
                create what is known as the world wide web today.
              </p>

              <p>
                In terms of web design and how we influence the data within the
                World Wide Web (WWW), I relate it to us coding and creating
                semantic markup. We use a series of data to create semantic
                markup, which in return encapsulates our websites information
                and give it meaning within the WWW. When a user searches for
                certain information, the data will help push though the
                information required to the user searching for it. There are
                endless ways we can manipulate and use data, which is very
                important within this course. The data we put in, will help
                shape our websites into a useful tool with useful information
                for the public. However, meaningless data won’t do us any
                justice, which is why it must be paired with visualisation.
                “Information is considered as useful data, which people can
                recognize and understand it.” (Chen 2005) It is important for us
                as web designers to understand how visualisation and
                representation function in order to give our data meaning.
              </p>

              <p>
                Scientific visualisation suggests that “the forms of data
                visualization often refers to simulations, waveforms or volume,
                in which data is explored, transformed and represented as an
                image or simulation in order to obtain insight into the
                phenomena.” (Li 2020, p.g 23) This is how we display our
                information. By means of images, sounds etc. However, it is
                important to understand the representation of this information.
                A standalone image will not provide one much context.
              </p>
              <p>
                We as web developers “need to make conscious decisions as to
                what you foreground, how you construct the signs, how you
                contextualize for interpretation. “(Wits 2023, p.g 21) and by
                doing that we need to first understand signs. Signs are what
                give our information meaning, as when a person looks at the
                information, we need to make sure that that person knows exactly
                what we are referring to within that information. These signs
                are “constructed out of a signifier and a signified” (Wits 2023,
                p.g 8) which are “given meaning through context and
                socio-cultural cues.” (Wits 2023, p.g 8) Without understanding
                these, interpretation is impossible and we as web designers will
                not be able to relay our information out efficiently. When we
                present our data, we need to be aware of how we represent that
                data.
              </p>

              <p>
                “Human perception plays an important role in data
                visualization.” (Ware 2012) We need to understand how we as
                humans perceive information and visual elements. “Human visual
                perception is a very complicated and subjective process, and
                that the effectiveness of the visualization for conveying
                objective understanding based on a wide range of subtle factors.
                “(Reuter, Tukey, Maloney, Pani, & Smith, 1990). It is
                complicated to assume how every person will perceive something,
                The “sign” being our singular piece of data will be influenced
                by the signifier and signified, which will be interpreted
                depending on what context surrounds and forms that data. “The
                construction of the sign matters. The choice of signifier to
                signified matters. (Wits 2023, p.g 9) and we need to manipulate
                this so that our data can be visualized correctly.
              </p>

              <p>
                As mentioned, not everyone will perceive your information the
                same as others which is where we can look at “four theories of
                preattentive processing, which are feature integration theory,
                texton theory, similarity theory, and guided search theory.”
                (Healey 2007) in order to get a ground of how the human body
                reacts and reads visual information. Within a website, the main
                theory I will discuss here is The Texton theory. This relies on
                properties such as width, heights, hues and how “easily an
                object can be distinguished from its distractors.” (Li 2020, p.g
                43) If we want certain data to stick out within our website, we
                need to understand this and make it stick out from the rest in
                order to stand out. By manipulating the data’s hue, patterns,
                width etc it should automatically receive special attention from
                the viewer.
              </p>

              <p>
                In a website point of view, this means we need to manipulate the
                colour or placement of data accordingly in order to attract
                certain people or give people certain cues of where to go and
                what to do. Our manipulation of data within our website will
                allow for people to visualize and interpret that data’s means
                and therefore act upon it. If we can understand the context and
                socio-cultural cues, we can correctly guide users throughout our
                website.
              </p>

              <p>
                Example is” Broadly, red is associated with danger, warning,
                attention, and stopping” (Golutvina, May 28) If a user
                incorrectly enters information within your website,
                understanding how to represent information we should use the
                colour red to alert them that they have entered something
                incorrectly. “If the error is not caused by the user, there is
                no need to bother people with the intensive, annoying red.”
                (Golutvina, May 28) we do not want to bombard the viewer with an
                intense annoying colour, unless something is wrong. It is vital
                to understand what our data represents and how the viewers will
                interpret it. This is the key to creating a successful and
                efficient website.

              <h2>Style Guide</h2>
              <p>
                With having to implement our api data from Nasa, i immediately
                thought of a space themed website where the Nasa live data would
                fit perfectly into. This website isnt a website about space, but
                rather just contains a dark theme centering around how the Nasa
                api would fit into appropriately. My colour themes revolve
                around black, white and light blue. This makes it easy on the
                viewers eye as the white text works well to contrast against the
                dark background. In order to not strain the viewers eye with
                multitude of white text i have also added light blue colours to
                contrast well against the dark background, but not be too bright
                like the white and cause eye strain.
              </p>

              <p>
                My homepage is simple and doesnt include a lot of information.
                Displayed on the left is a brief overview of the website.
                Underneath is a button which leads into the data visuals page
                which will contain all visual data within the future. On the
                right side of the page, atop the image of the earth the Nasa
                live api would be displayed. My navbar is also kept simple. A
                few links to all my pages with the inclusion of a moon shaped
                logo on the left.
              </p>
              <p>
                For now all of my pages follow the same background as they are
                just placeholders for the meantime. My documents page is where
                users can find my blog posts as well as design documents
                displaying my process on the website. I have structured it to be
                two bodies of text with scroll bars side by side. This gives the
                page a neat look especially since the blog post and design doc
                contain so much information.
              </p>
              <p>
                The background to these textboxes are transparent with a slight
                light blue hue in order to match the background. The blue hue
                once again adding to the themes of colours used. I found it also
                easier on the eye as a solid background would stand out too much
                from the image in the back. It would not only look ugly and take
                away from the visuals of the background but it would also be
                straining as there would be way too many colours showcased on
                the page.
              </p>

              <h2>UI and UX</h2>
              <p>
                Simplicity was the main focus of my website. Since it would be
                structured around data visualization, i wanted to create a
                modern simplstic look so that when data api's and arts were
                added it wouldnt feel cluttered. For this reason it would make
                it very easy for the user to navigate around the pages and view
                the different information without it being cluttered and causin
                eye strain.
              </p>

              <p>
                My home page is simple. As explained within the style guide,
                features a brief summary of the website along with a button that
                will take the user to the visual data page if they wish to learn
                more about what this website is about. The contrasting white
                text leads the viewers eyes to the brief first. My plan would be
                to also add the Nasa api on the right of the homepage as it is
                equally improtant and relevant to what the website is about. The
                users eyes would wander back and forth between the two to give
                them a better understanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                My navbar is displayed at the top right, above the summary and
                background image to stand out from them. Its font not as big as
                the homepage heading as it is not the main focal point of the
                page. However it is a white contrasting colour that still sticks
                out and once users are done exploring the homepage their
                attention can be averted to the navbar. When one hovers their
                cursor over it, it displays a interactive white line transition
                signaling to users which link they are hovering over and where
                it would take them.
              </p>

              <p>
                My documents page being the only active page besides the
                homepage offers the same consistent background but i have
                decided to implement two text boxes with scroll bars aside as
                the information from my blogs and my design document are large.
                Displaying them in these small boxes gives my page the same
                consistent simplistic feel and doesnt trouble the users with
                bodies and bodies of information. Rather they can choose what
                they wish to view by scrolling.
              </p>
              <p>
                The website as a whole isnt revolving around space and nasa
                apis, but rather how i use and structure my data. My homepage
                would cater for the display of the nasa api where the rest of my
                pages will feature other data and information added in the
                future. Ive done this to show the user that i can implement data
                accordingly and not have a website with a live Nasa information
                displayed randomly. It all has to fit in place and every bit of
                information and display has to have a consistent meaning behind
                it.

                  My first iteration included a homepage where you could scroll

                  hand side of the page would be a huge button which would take

                  My nasa API would be displayed further down below the page. I
                  eventually scrapped this idea and thought it would be useless
                  just to put that information down there with no context.

                  My final iteration kept a similar homepage but i decided to
                  make the page fixed so that you cannot scroll down. The api
                  would be displayed on the right of the websites summary. A
                  small button to "learn more" about what i mean about data
                  visualization would now take you to the data visuals page.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have also decided to rework my navbars contents. My blogs
                  and design doc now sit all within the documents page. My data
                  visuals and data artwork have their own links
                </p>

                <p>
                  Overall i think this layout works very well. It is simplistic
                  and tells viewers the message of the website clearly. By
                  adding in my website summary on the left, and then giving an
                  example of it on the right through the api is a nice
                  introduction to my website and its contents.

                <p><b>First Iteration</b></p>
                <div class="image1">
                  <img
                    src="Images/documentsFirst.png"
                    alt="Documents Page First Iteration"

                    height="100%"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  My first iteration included a blogpost section on the left of
                  the page. Each blog post would have their own text boxes. As
                  the user would scroll further down the actual page it would
                  reveal more blogs.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On the right hand side would be the design document, however
                  the information would just sit neatly atop the page and as you
                  scroll down the page, more document information would be
                  revealed. My page also included a main title, describing what
                  the page is about.
                </p>

                <p><b>Final Iteration</b></p>
                <div class="image2">
                  <img
                    src="Images/documentsFinal.png"
                    alt="Documents Page Final Iteration"
                    width="100%"
                    height="100%"
                  />
                </div>

                <p>
                  Even though my final is similar to the first. I hae decided to
                  confine it even further. The page still includes the blog
                  posts on the left within a scroll text box, however the design
                  doc would also be confined into a scroll text box as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have decided to implement this as ive realized it would be
                  stupid for the user to endlessly scroll down the whole page
                  for a design document that would contain so much information.
                  Not only that but on the left would just be boxes and boxes of
                  blog posts. For now, i have one blog post and my design doc is
                  quite lengthy. If i kept the first iteration when the user
                  scrolls down it would just be empty on the left side where
                  future blog posts would sit.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Not only this but there would be an information overload for
                  the user with bodies and bodies of text everywhere. In
                  confining the two sections within text boxes, the user can
                  stay in one place and navigate its contents way more easily.
                  It also looks way neater and everything has its place on the
                  page.
