                        This week we learnt about data visualazation and how “Data
                        visualization often results in graphical images of data or
                        concepts, which assists making decisions” (Ware 2012). In this
                        day and age, it is best paired up with computer software where
                        it can be best displayed across all media forms too allow for
                        quicker and more efficient data analysing. In order to better
                        understand Data visualisation, we need to separate it into two
                        categories. Data and visualisation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Data can be many things, but it is usually referred to
                        unprocessed information that stands alone and has no meaning. An
                        example of this is the number 3. This is the primary data. The
                        secondary data “can be considered as information.” (Li 2020, p.g
                        21) Where a collection of the primary data is bunched together
                        to create meaning. This does not just have to be something
                        physical, but something technological as well such as how within
                        computers, data is a collection of 1s and 0s which transmit
                        electrical signals. We are exposed to data everyday like the
                        “World Wide Web, cellular calls, networks of smart home
                        applications” (Li 2020, p.g 20). Within the online world, these
                        collections of data are then manipulated in countless ways to
                        create what is known as the world wide web today.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In terms of web design and how we influence the data within the
                        World Wide Web (WWW), I relate it to us coding and creating
                        semantic markup. We use a series of data to create semantic
                        markup, which in return encapsulates our websites information
                        and give it meaning within the WWW. When a user searches for
                        certain information, the data will help push though the
                        information required to the user searching for it. There are
                        endless ways we can manipulate and use data, which is very
                        important within this course. The data we put in, will help
                        shape our websites into a useful tool with useful information
                        for the public. However, meaningless data won’t do us any
                        justice, which is why it must be paired with visualisation.
                        “Information is considered as useful data, which people can
                        recognize and understand it.” (Chen 2005) It is important for us
                        as web designers to understand how visualisation and
                        representation function in order to give our data meaning.

                    <p>
                        Scientific visualisation suggests that “the forms of data
                        visualization often refers to simulations, waveforms or volume,
                        in which data is explored, transformed and represented as an
                        image or simulation in order to obtain insight into the
                        phenomena.” (Li 2020, p.g 23) This is how we display our
                        information. By means of images, sounds etc. However, it is
                        important to understand the representation of this information.
                        A standalone image will not provide one much context.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We as web developers “need to make conscious decisions as to
                        what you foreground, how you construct the signs, how you
                        contextualize for interpretation. “(Wits 2023, p.g 21) and by
                        doing that we need to first understand signs. Signs are what
                        give our information meaning, as when a person looks at the
                        information, we need to make sure that that person knows exactly
                        what we are referring to within that information. These signs
                        are “constructed out of a signifier and a signified” (Wits 2023,
                        p.g 8) which are “given meaning through context and
                        socio-cultural cues.” (Wits 2023, p.g 8) Without understanding
                        these, interpretation is impossible and we as web designers will
                        not be able to relay our information out efficiently. When we
                        present our data, we need to be aware of how we represent that
                        data.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        “Human perception plays an important role in data
                        visualization.” (Ware 2012) We need to understand how we as
                        humans perceive information and visual elements. “Human visual
                        perception is a very complicated and subjective process, and
                        that the effectiveness of the visualization for conveying
                        objective understanding based on a wide range of subtle factors.
                        “(Reuter, Tukey, Maloney, Pani, & Smith, 1990). It is
                        complicated to assume how every person will perceive something,
                        The “sign” being our singular piece of data will be influenced
                        by the signifier and signified, which will be interpreted
                        depending on what context surrounds and forms that data. “The
                        construction of the sign matters. The choice of signifier to
                        signified matters. (Wits 2023, p.g 9) and we need to manipulate
                        this so that our data can be visualized correctly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As mentioned, not everyone will perceive your information the
                        same as others which is where we can look at “four theories of
                        preattentive processing, which are feature integration theory,
                        texton theory, similarity theory, and guided search theory.”
                        (Healey 2007) in order to get a ground of how the human body
                        reacts and reads visual information. Within a website, the main
                        theory I will discuss here is The Texton theory. This relies on
                        properties such as width, heights, hues and how “easily an
                        object can be distinguished from its distractors.” (Li 2020, p.g
                        43) If we want certain data to stick out within our website, we
                        need to understand this and make it stick out from the rest in
                        order to stand out. By manipulating the data’s hue, patterns,
                        width etc it should automatically receive special attention from
                        the viewer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a website point of view, this means we need to manipulate the
                        colour or placement of data accordingly in order to attract
                        certain people or give people certain cues of where to go and
                        what to do. Our manipulation of data within our website will
                        allow for people to visualize and interpret that data’s means
                        and therefore act upon it. If we can understand the context and
                        socio-cultural cues, we can correctly guide users throughout our
                        website.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Example is” Broadly, red is associated with danger, warning,
                        attention, and stopping” (Golutvina, May 28) If a user
                        incorrectly enters information within your website,
                        understanding how to represent information we should use the
                        colour red to alert them that they have entered something
                        incorrectly. “If the error is not caused by the user, there is
                        no need to bother people with the intensive, annoying red.”
                        (Golutvina, May 28) we do not want to bombard the viewer with an
                        intense annoying colour, unless something is wrong. It is vital
                        to understand what our data represents and how the viewers will
                        interpret it. This is the key to creating a successful and
                        efficient website.
